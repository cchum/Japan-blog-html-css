This project is a personal HTML and CSS website inspired by my trip to Japan. I built it to practice front-end fundamentals while highlighting Japanâ€™s culture and beauty. The site focuses on clean structure with HTML, visually appealing design through CSS, and simple navigation for a smooth user experience.
