                <p>What can be said about the rising sun country Japan. 
                    One of the best places to visit to visit. Drawing so 
                    many tourist a year. They have so much to offer. The 
                    quality of the food there is amazing. The people 
                    there are just so nice. They really are people that 
                    care about each otherand not have that mind set of 
                    caring abotu themselves. Differnt part of the 
                    city has their own speical quircks and things to do. 
                    Kyoto and Tokyo are just so differnt, but special in 
                    their own way. You just have to go and see it. 
                    Osaka and Nara are on the list to mention that needs to 
                    be visited. You can get lost in the beuty of Japan and 
                    what it has to offer. There are so many things that 
                    I could go on about in this beautiful coutnry.

                <h2>Kyoto Has My Heart</h2>
                <p>Kyoto is one of the most beautiful places that I have ever 
                    visited. I always wondered why people loved it so much, until
                    I came here to see for myself. I am not kidding when I say this, this
                    city stole my heart away.
